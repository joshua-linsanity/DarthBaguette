TreeHacks is where challenge meets creativity, and as a FLI student from rural California, I’ve faced my fair share of both. Growing up without a safety net meant that every technical win, from developing numerical models at NASA JPL to creating 'Moco,' an emergency signaling app, was hard-won. Each project was more than an academic exercise—it was a necessity-driven pursuit to innovate solutions for real problems, like personal safety for the vulnerable or even geologic analysis in the leadup to NASA's Europa Clipper mission. I see TreeHacks as a place to build on these experiences, connect with others who’ve overcome unique hurdles, and tackle the hard problems that define our future. It’s about forging lasting impact through tech, and with TreeHacks, I hope to gain not just new skills, but a network of authentic, driven peers who share a passion for pushing boundaries in meaningful ways.

"Moco" began as a response to a real, pressing need. I grew up in an environment where I witnessed firsthand how vulnerable my friends and family could feel in everyday situations: walking alone at night, being at a crowded event, or even during a simple commute. Moco, a discreet emergency signaling system, became my way of addressing that vulnerability. With a small wrist gesture, users can subtly trigger a pre-programmed alert, instantly notifying contacts with critical information—all without attracting attention. Developing Moco was challenging in several respects: it required precise data wrangling through Apple Watch sensors, geometric mapping and dynamic time warping algorithms, and server-side processing, but more than anything, it required careful thoughtfulness and consideration. Every line of code was written with a single goal in mind: to empower people to feel safe when they need it most. To me, that makes Moco my most meaningful creation.

I dream of advancing numerical partial differential equations, especially in the context of general relativity and computing hamiltonians in quantum mechanics. Numerical techniques to PDEs with theoretical guarantees empower us to approximate the behavior of complex dynamical systems, ranging from black hole binary mergers to blood flow through human arteries. Thus importantly, PDEs are more than just my theoretical interest: they have the potential to revolutionize health and drug delivery, such as through the powerful Navier-Stokes equation, which models fluid flow and turbulence. I aim to improve algorithms for stability, convergence, and computational efficiency to improve the quality of simulations of both the galaxy at large and the miniscule molecules in our bodies. I've taken my first steps by already, learning to implement and prove fundamental results about algorithms in simple relativistic systems, but I aspire one day to reach even further to push the edge of science.

my girlfriend (and future wife, if i have anything to say about it!) is a stanford tree. i visit her as often as i can, so palo alto already feels more like home than princeton, haha
